# Tasty Dinery Hardware 🍔☕️ [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) 

## Introduction
Following the implementation of **Tasty Dinery client mobile application** using **Dart Flutter**, this implements further to automate and streamlining order serving at cafeteria. 

The implementation requires one to have the **quirc.zip library** added to the **arduino** for implementation of quirc objects to be used in qr code scanning and decoding. Or another approach is to use **python openCV** but with that, the device will fail to operate as a standalone device unless a raspberry pi micro-controller is employed.

After adding the zip file, the code can now be compiled and uploaded to the esp32-CAM micro-controller

Star⭐ the repo if you like what you see 😉.  

**Happy Coding**
